In addition to the [listed dependencies](https://github.com/AprilSylph/XKit-Rewritten/network/dependencies#package.json), the project also uses:
- [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) by Nicolas Gallagher
- toggle-button.css by Mozilla (extracted from Firefox's about:addons)

#### Special thanks
This project would not exist without the efforts of the [contributors to the New XKit project](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/graphs/contributors).

In particular, the project owes its viability to:
- [**@nightpool**](https://github.com/nightpool), for authoring the original conceptual "XKit 8" ([new-xkit/x8](https://github.com/new-xkit/x8)), and bringing React property accessing to XKit 7
- [**@hobinjk**](https://github.com/hobinjk), for leading the New XKit project, and authoring XKit 7's CSS map helpers
- [**@atesh**](https://github.com/atesh), for authoring the original XKit addon
