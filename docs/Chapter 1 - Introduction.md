Since this project is a WebExtension, it's recommended to test your changes as you go. This means ideally making a local clone of your fork and editing the files on your machine, before pushing back to GitHub. But, if that's too scary, this repository is also set up to accommodate development without leaving the GitHub web interface; it's just a little less smooth.
