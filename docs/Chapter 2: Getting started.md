# Getting started

This guide details 

## Prerequisites

- [Download and install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for your platform
- [Install EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/#download) for your favourite text editor
- Install the project dependencies with **`npm install`**

## Loading the project into the browser

The extension source code is located in `src/`. Before loading your development version, first be sure to disable the release version if you have it installed on the browser you're testing on.

- Firefox: [Loading a temporary extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging#Extensions)
- Chromium: [Load an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/#manifest)

Be sure to reload the extension each time you modify its files, and refresh any open Tumblr tabs in that browser. Otherwise, your changes may not be reflected.
