Welcome to the XKit Rewritten user guide.

**XKit Rewritten** is a browser extension which adds extra features to Tumblr's new React-based web client (codename: "Redpop"), which launched in April 2020. It is the successor to XKit 7 ("XKit"/"New XKit"), a userscript framework designed to target Tumblr's previous web interface (codename: "Prima").
 
This project started in July 2020 and entered Beta in March 2021.

## Frequently asked questions

> **Do I need to remove New XKit to install XKit Rewritten?**

No, you don't! The two should not conflict. If running them at the same time causes any problems, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/AprilSylph/XKit-Rewritten/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml) for it. That said, running New XKit features while also running their XKit Rewritten counterparts is not recommended for performance reasons.

> **Where's Old Blue?**

The pre-2019 Tumblr palette is available via the separate extension [Palettes for Tumblr](https://github.com/AprilSylph/Palettes-for-Tumblr#readme).

> **Is Outbox coming back?**

Outbox has been rebuilt as the separate extension [Outbox for Tumblr](https://github.com/AprilSylph/Outbox-for-Tumblr#readme).
