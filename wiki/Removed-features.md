Some scripts have been moved elsewhere, or removed for being obsolete.

---

## Audio Downloader
> Download Tumblr-hosted audio

This script added a download button underneath audio blocks to download the audio file. It was removed with the introduction of [Vanilla Audio](Features#vanilla-audio), since browser-native audio controls in Firefox and Chromium allow downloading.

## Condensed Reblogs
> Shorten the reblog trail

This script would visually collapse the reblog trail in lieu of being able to remove trail items from the post itself. It was replaced with [Trim Reblogs](Features#trim-reblogs).

## Disable GIFs
> Pause GIFs until you hover over them

This script's behaviour has been moved to an option in [AccessKit](Features#accesskit).

## Old Blue
> True low-contrast classic

This script would override Tumblr's palette to resemble the colour scheme used prior to the January 2019 accessibility update. This palette is now included in the separate addon [Palettes for Tumblr](https://github.com/AprilSylph/Palettes-for-Tumblr#readme).
