When you install the addon, its icon should be added to your browser toolbar. Click this icon to open the control panel and configure XKit to your needs. (On Chrome and derivative browsers, this may be hidden under a generic "Extensions" button.)

Once you have the control panel open, there are three tabs: Configuration, Backup, and Links.

## Configuration

### Filters

Typing into the search bar will automatically filter features to those containing matching text in their titles, descriptions, or preferences. To stop searching, simply clear the input.

You can also filter to only features which are enabled, or only features which are disabled. You do not need to use the search input in order to use this dropdown.

### Features

To enable a feature, click the toggle button to the right of the feature's information. The effect on Tumblr should happen instantly if you have a Tumblr tab open and visible.

To configure a feature, click on the feature's icon, information, or any of the white space containing it. This will open that feature's preferences, allowing further configuration. Some features do nothing until they are configured.

## Backup

### Export

This section displays your current configuration, and provides buttons to copy it to the clipboard (Copy All) or to download it to file (Download).

### Import

This section consists of a textarea to paste previously copied or saved configuration into, and a Restore button which will loosely validate and save the provided data to your settings. This import tool only works with XKit Rewritten configuration data, and cannot read XKit 7 exports.
